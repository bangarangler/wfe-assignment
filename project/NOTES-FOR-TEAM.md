## HEY TEAM!

Just wanted to thank you for taking the time to review.  I'm chatty so will try to keep this brief but wanted you to have a small idea of my thought process and what I have done.

### Task # 
For Task One, I went overboard and instead of using useState and adding the fields in, I opted for useReducer.  I hope you don't use this as a mark against me in adding un-needed complexity.  I just wanted to have further conversation about state machines, UI state, and display that if perhaps a more complex component we could utilize a reducer and have a easier time updating the state of the component by thinking about in in terms of actions a user is taking.  

I'm totally aware this is not required but wanted to show that I am capable of thinking about future complexity and showcasing one of many ways we could go about making it better and easier to work with.  As well as having types and more safety in place.

One call out I noticed after doing task one is that we have some duplicate types.  I didn't want to spend any longer given this is an interview process and I wanted to move this forward and chat with you guys about it.  But another thing I would change is unifying the types across the back and frontend.  We could accomplish this in many ways -> GrahpQL and code-gen based off a schema, a tool like Zod which gives us a schema and utilization of types front and back, as well as other ways we could have the same types across the entire stack.

I simply copied and pasted and omited the phoneError on the way to the backend just to complete and move on as I didn't want to get overley fancy early days.  I hope this makes since to you all and more than anything will give us fun stuff to discuss in the next rounds should we move forward.

That aside, you can now add the new required fields and they are set up to be added to the "foo" -> email console log.

### Task #2
I took a simple approach here, I just added a portal_url to the db and did a very basic check for this field and direct the user to the portal URL if it exists. Otherwise, we just take them to /eligibility.  Simple, nothing fancy leaves us room to discuss alternate options and pros and cons of each.

With further information on the requirements I could have taken this in another direction and would be happy to do so if required.  As I went more complicated for task 1 i figured I would give task 2 a simple approach.

I look forward to chatting with you all and thank you so much for taking your time and reviewing the work.  I hope you all have a fantastic day and I very much look forward to talking tech with all of you!
